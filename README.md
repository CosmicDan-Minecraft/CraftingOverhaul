# CraftingOverhaul
### Minecraft mod. Provides a replacement, advanced crafting interface.

#### License:
* This mod is licensed under Apache License 2.0. See LICENSE.txt for details.
* Additional component/asset licenses, if any, specified in LICENSE-ADDITIONAL.txt where applicable.

#### Requirements:
* Refer to build.gradle for required Minecraft and expected Forge version.

#### Compiling:
* Download Forge source and extract to new directory. Ensure it is the same version as listed in build.gradle in this repo. YMMV with later Forge versions.
* Delete the "src" directory and "build.gradle" file from this unpaced Forge source.
* Copy all contents from this cloned repository to the unpacked Forge source directory, over-writing all when prompted.
* Setup Forge as usual.
* NB: build.cmd (if present) is my own helper script for versioning, it expects GnuWin32 sed/grep in your PATH. It's not important for you :)
